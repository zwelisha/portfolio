              I am a self-starter, flexible and adaptable, who enjoys solving problems using Mathematical methods and Computer Science algorithms.
              I was part of the Rhodes University team (Team Y NOTS) that won the regional competition, competing in the Standard Bank Impact Challenge (formerly known as the Standard Bank IT Challenge), during the finals in Johannesburg we were given two days to develop a unique blockchain based system that solves an existing problem. I came third in that competition.

              I have developed and maintained 13 websites since 2014. Furthermore, I have a strong desire to learn new languages and systems that automate the business process.

              Despite being a nerdy person, I enjoy rowing, skating and swimming on weekends. Other than software development, I enjoy contributing to rational debates in writing. I recently wrote an article about the positive impact of accepting a larger population of refugees on the host country.
              Frankly speaking, I enjoy most sports. In 2016 during Drostdy Hall annual awards at Rhodes University, I was awarded the "Internal Sportsperson of the Year" accolade after scoring higher points in residence league which involved a variety of sports including underwater hockey, tennis, athletics, touch rugby, soccer and swimming. On the same year, I was also a member of the Rhodes Canoeing Club as a novice.

              Skilled in Java, SQL, Python, Bootstrap, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), C#, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML PHP, PHP Laravel, JuPyter, Materialize CSS, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Power Point, Microsoft Access, MySQL, XAMPP, Canva Graphic Design, php artisan, php tinker, bash commands.

              I recently wrote an article about Accepting a large population of refugees into a country and its positive impact, please see here: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accepting-large-population-refugees-has-positive-impact-mthethwa/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accepting-large-population-refugees-has-positive-impact-mthethwa/</a>

            <h3>What do I want from my next job</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Looking for a remote opportunity in front-end or back-end web development where
              I will learn and put my skills into use alongside a team of experienced developers who will help me grow as a young
              developer. <br>
              My main interest is developing software that advances humanity.
              Despite being a junior developer, I have accomplished and solved complicated business problems for micro-enterprises in rural communities.
              All the software solutions I provided were mainly web application based and I used CSS, HTML, Javascript, PHP (for backend) and
              Bootstrap (for front-end); as a result,
              I would love to work with these languages and focus mainly on web-based applications.<br>

              In addition, I understand object-oriented programming in Java, Python and C# and
              I feel comfortable working with these languages due to their usability and simplicity. Furthermore, I am currently up-skilling on Data Engineering using Python.<br>
              <span class="emphasised-text">
                Please note I am currently available for remote work only on weekeds or after 17:30 everyday.
                I will be able to work full time at the end of October 2020.

            <h3>2017 Standard Bank IT Challenge (South African Universities Programming Olympiad)</h3>
            <p>
              This was a blockchain based competition where we were given 48 hours to identify an existing problem and implement a blockchain based solution to solve the identified problem. My team and I created a system that enables financial donors to audit all charity organisations they donate the money to by tracking all their transactions. This was an exciting project since I worked with people I met at the competition. Standard Bank decided to shuffle the teams, as a result there was not even a single member from Rhodes University in my team for the IdeaChain, which made me a bit uncomfortable. However, the most exciting part was leading the team which involved drawing system diagrams, clarifying concepts in isiXhosa to other team members and equally dividing the work. In addition, I was responsible for coding the whole front-end part of the system since there were only six members in the team, and only three of us had experience in practical software development other than basic school practicals. Even though, the whole project was stressful, it was exciting to see how fast paced the software development industry is in the real world. The support of companies such as Consensys and Luno made the whole process easier.
