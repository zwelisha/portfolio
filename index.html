            I am a self-starter, flexible, and adaptable, who enjoys solving problems using Mathematical methods and Computer Science algorithms.
            I was part of the Rhodes University team (Team Y NOTS) that won the regional competition competing in the 
            Standard Bank Impact Challenge (formerly known as the Standard Bank IT Challenge). 
            During the finals in Johannesburg we were given two days to develop a unique blockchain-based system that solves an existing problem. 
            I came third in that competition. I have developed and maintained 13 websites since 2014. Furthermore, 
            I have a strong desire to learn new languages and systems that automate the business process. Despite being a nerdy person, 
            I enjoy rowing, skating, and swimming on weekends. Other than software development, I enjoy contributing to rational debates in writing. 
            I recently wrote an article about the positive impact of accepting a large population of refugees into a country
              please see here: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accepting-large-population-refugees-has-positive-impact-mthethwa/">

            <h3>What do I want from my next job</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Looking for a remote opportunity in front-end or back-end web development where
              I will learn and put my skills into use alongside a team of experienced developers who will help me grow as a young
              developer. <br>
              My main interest is developing software that advances humanity.
              Despite being a junior developer, I have accomplished and solved complicated business problems for micro-enterprises in rural communities.
              All the software solutions I provided were mainly web application based and I used CSS, HTML, Javascript, PHP (for backend) and
              Bootstrap (for front-end); as a result,
              I would love to work with these languages and focus mainly on web-based applications.<br>

              In addition, I understand object-oriented programming in Java, Python and C# and
              I feel comfortable working with these languages due to their usability and simplicity.
              Furthermore, I am currently up-skilling on Data Engineering using Python.<br>
              <span class="emphasised-text">
                Please note I am currently available for remote work only on weekeds or after 17:30 everyday.
                I will be able to work full time at the end of October 2020.

            <h3>British American Tobacco Glo Application</h3>
            <p>
              I worked on a content management system for British American Tobacco's web application while working for Lacuna Innovation, a German company
              with offices in Cape Town, Nepal and Berlin.
              I was responsible for both front-end and back-end development. The front-end framework I used is called Materialize.
              In addition, to HTML and CSS, I used Jquery for Javascript. The back-end was coded in Java and SQL. Furthermore,
              I worked with a team of designers and my job was to write code based on their design.

            <h3>Elitest (Spain National Police Training Academy) SEO</h3>
            <p>
                Elitest (<a href="https://www.elitest.es/">www.elitest.es/</a>) CEO, Guillermo Ferreiro asked me to optimise his national police training academy websites
                for search engines to rank it higher. His main objective was to increase sales
                In addition, I used Google Developer Tools to test device friendliness and speed.
            </p>

            <h3>Theo Tours Website and Booking System</h3>
            <p>
                Theo Tours (<a href="https://www.theotours.co.za">www.theotours.co.za</a>) wanted their website to be revamped for the company to be able to fully automate the business process.
                Firstly, I had to redesign the entire website and add additional pages such as the internships page for tourism students
                who would love to do internships at Theo Tours. The page allows the interns to apply online to be shortlisted for interviews.

                Secondly, the company wanted all tour bookings to be done online and clients to get instant feedback.
                Thirdly, I had to work on SEO (Search Engine Optimization) to ensure the company ranks higher on Google and appear
                first in google search results for related search queries.

                Finally, Theo, the company owner wanted his clients to write Trip Advisor reviews on the website after each and every tour.
                I accomplished his requirements by checking the API documentation of Trip Advisor for website plugins and added a section that displays
                Trip Advisor live reviews. In addition, I added a section where tourists could write reviews using their Trip Advisor accounts.
                This was another individual project that I enjoyed the most. As a big fan of PHP,
                I used PHP and MySQL for back-end, Bootstrap for front-end and xampp server for development.

            <h3>Dr Thokozani Mhlambi (UCT Music Lecturer Personal Website)</h3>
            <p>
                I designed and developed Dr Thokozani Mhlambi's personal music website (<a href="https://www.thokozanimhlambi.com">www.thokozanimhlambi.com</a>).
                Dr Mhlambi wanted an advanced personal music website where he would be able to connect with his followers and fellow academics.
                In addition, he wanted to engage with followers on social media; as a result, I had to use the Facebook APIs to include a
                Facebook live feed on the home page.

                Furthermore, I had to create a small content management system where he could register, login and post articles under the writings page.
                In this project I used raw PHP and MySQL for back-end and Bootstrap for front-end.
                In this project I did not use any programming methodology since I did the whole project alone, however,
                I would have used the agile methodology had I been in a team. The whole project was developed using XAMPP for easy testing
                offline before uploading to the server.

                In addition, I used Google Developer Tools to test device friendliness and speed.

                  <img id="team_natit" class="hackathon-image" src="assets/images/natit.png" alt="Team Natit, GKHack19">
                  <figcaption>Team Natit, From Left to Right : Tshepo Mohlatlole, Masai Mahapa, Zweli Mthethwa, Guy Luyanda Maluleke and Lobohang Mokoena</figcaption>
              <p>
                Every year the CPSI (Government Component Centre for Public Service Innovation) sponsors the annual Geekkulcha Hackathon, with the aim of finding
                innovative solutions to improve service delivery and allowing all software developers regardless of where they work
                to come up with solutions that advance humanity. My team, team Natit, participated and were among the best 10 teams that went to the finals where
                we lost to The Khabubu Brothers, Team Qubit and Cambridge Analytica, who took first, second and third positions, respectively.
                Beating more than 30 teams during the elimination rounds. During this hackathon, my team consisted of aspiring Copywriters (Guy Luyanda Maluleke),
                Data Engineers (Tshepo Mohlatlole and myself), Web Developers(Lebohang Mokoena) and data scientists (Masai Mahapa and Themba Mbulukwana).

            <h3>2017 Standard Bank IT Challenge (South African Universities Programming Olympiad) - 3rd Place</h3>
            <p>
              This was a blockchain based competition where we were given 48 hours to identify an existing problem and implement
              a blockchain based solution to solve the identified problem. My team and I created a system that enables financial
              donors to audit all charity organisations they donate the money to by tracking all their transactions.
              This was an exciting project since I worked with people I met at the competition. Standard Bank decided to shuffle the teams,
              as a result there was not even a single member from Rhodes University in my team for the IdeaChain, which made me a bit uncomfortable.
              However, the most exciting part was leading the team which involved drawing system diagrams, clarifying concepts in isiXhosa to other
              team members and equally dividing the work. In addition, I was responsible for coding the whole front-end part of the system since
              there were only six members in the team, and only three of us had experience in practical software development other than basic
              school practicals. Even though, the whole project was stressful, it was exciting to see how fast paced the software development
              industry is in the real world. The support of companies such as Consensys and Luno made the whole process easier.

            <p>
                The International Collegiate Programming Contest is an algorithmic programming contest for college students.
                It is by far the most fierce and rigorously contested programming challenge for college students.
                Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems,
                fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. This hackathon, is not only about
                submitting solutions that work. Submitted algorithms are timed for efficiency. In 2016, my our team (Team Y Nots) came 3rd at Rhodes University
                and 26th in Africa. It was a huge success considering the strong competition brought by UCT, WITS, UP and Teams from other African Universities,
                since there wer more than 90 teams in total.
